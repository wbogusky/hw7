Here is the midterm project. I was inspired by the Musical Bounces piece shown in class, and developed my own more rhythmic application of similar elements. I am please with the result, however I would like to refine my understanding of the code that changes the pitch of the chimes so that I can be more specific about the scale in which the melodies are formed.
